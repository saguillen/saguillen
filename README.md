## Hi I'm Sergio 👋


- ✅ SW & Data Engineer | Cybersecurity (Yep, I've worked in all three! 👾)
- 🔹 I bring a multifaceted background in cybersecurity, data analysis, and software engineering. Having worked across these fields, I bridge the gap between data-driven decision-making and cutting-edge software and security practices. Whether it's making and securing data pipelines, analyzing threats, or reinforcing cloud security, I thrive at the intersection of technology, software and security.
- 🔐 Always learning. Targeting multiple certifications for my work.
- Meanwhile, apart from just going to work (and when im not busy) I like to build cool projects
  🔹 Created my own Discord bot to find an empty classroom to study B)
  🔹 Trained a computer vision model on my cats 🐱
  🔹 My university thesis? Data poisoning network traffic to attack ML models
  🔹 Projects with Espressif & Arduino chips/modules 🔹 EAFC 24 players stats prediction in the next game (Just for fun)
